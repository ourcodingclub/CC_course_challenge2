### Elena's Workflow  

#### Goals and To Do (based on the 'Specific tasks' subsection of the [Challenge level 2](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/DL/challenge2.html) website:  
#### 1. Goal: Clean the data  
Clean and filter the data to the sites and woodland types of interests:  
- Restrict the NWSS observations to the following dominant habitat types:  
    - Native pinewood  
    - Upland birchwood  
    - Upland mixed ashwood  
    - Upland oakwood  
    - Wet woodland  
    - Lowland mixed deciduous woodland  
- Restrict the NNR shapefile to the following areas, lump the last three under the same name, and rename as indicated:  
    - Great Trossachs Forest (rename to "Trossachs")  
    - Glen Affric (leave as such)  
    - Cairngorms (part of the "Cairngorms" group)  
    - Mar Lodge Estate (part of the "Cairngorms" group)  
    - Abernethy (part of the "Cairngorms" group)  
NB: There are 6 more NNRs in the Cairngorms National Park, but these three are large ones within the core of the park, and the only ones we'll be considering for this analysis.
#### 1. To Do:   
- [ ] load the dataset and assign it to an object   
- [ ] use pipes and the dplyr package to edit that object based on the goals above   
#### 2.
