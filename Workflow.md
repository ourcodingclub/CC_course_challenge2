### Elena's Workflow  

#### Goals and To Do (based on the 'Specific tasks' section of the [Challenge level 2](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/DL/challenge2.html) website):  
#### 1. Goal: Clean the data  
Clean and filter the data to the sites and woodland types of interests:  
- Restrict the NWSS observations to the following dominant habitat types:  
    - Native pinewood  
    - Upland birchwood  
    - Upland mixed ashwood  
    - Upland oakwood  
    - Wet woodland  
    - Lowland mixed deciduous woodland  
- Restrict the NNR shapefile to the following areas, lump the last three under the same name, and rename as indicated:  
    - Great Trossachs Forest (rename to "Trossachs")  
    - Glen Affric (leave as such)  
    - Cairngorms (part of the "Cairngorms" group)  
    - Mar Lodge Estate (part of the "Cairngorms" group)  
    - Abernethy (part of the "Cairngorms" group)  
NB: There are 6 more NNRs in the Cairngorms National Park, but these three are large ones within the core of the park, and the only ones we'll be considering for this analysis.
#### 1. To Do:   
- [x] load the datasets and assign them to objects   
- [x] use pipes and the dplyr package to edit that object based on the goals above   
#### 2. Goal: Map the areas of interest
Create a map for each of the three areas (Cairngorms, Trossachs, and Glen Affric) showing the geographical distribution of the priority habitats.
- Create a colour palette that you will use consistently to refer to the habitat types
â€¢	Be prepared to answer the question:
- What type(s) of priority habitat is (are) found in the Trossachs but not in the other two areas?
#### 2. To Do:
- [ ] Count the number of habitat types
- [ ] Create a color palette for the habitat types
- [ ]
